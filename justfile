# Authority: livespec/SPECIFICATION/non-functional-requirements.md
#   §"Enforcement-suite invocation" — `just` is the canonical entry
#   point for every dev-tooling invocation. Lefthook and CI MUST
#   delegate to `just <target>`; direct tool invocations are banned
#   (enforced by the no-direct-tool-invocation check).
#
# Authority: livespec/SPECIFICATION/contracts.md
#   §"Pre-commit step ordering" — gates wired in lefthook.yml mirror
#   the spec-required ordering.
#   §"Shared code sync — livespec-runtime" / §"Shared code sync —
#   livespec-dev-tooling" — the `check:` aggregate below wires EVERY
#   canonical check slug emitted by
#   `python -m livespec_dev_tooling.canonical_checks --json`, in
#   alphabetical order, per the wiring-completeness invariant
#   enforced by `check-aggregate-completeness` (epic li-univck Phase
#   1.3). livespec-runtime self-hosts the full canonical aggregate
#   from livespec-dev-tooling v0.4.0 onwards (epic li-univck Phase
#   3.3, work-item li-runwir).

# `skip` — space-separated list of `check:` aggregate targets to omit
# from a single run (epic li-cvaudit, cvredmd + cvnoarg). Default empty:
# the full aggregate runs. The Red-mode pre-commit overrides it on the
# command line — `just skip="check-coverage check-per-file-coverage" check`
# — so the coverage gates are not run at the Red commit (coverage is
# verified at the Green amend). The Green-amend pre-commit overrides it
# with `just skip="check-red-green-replay" check` so the no-arg replay
# variant does not reject the in-progress Red HEAD. This is a
# self-contained just variable; it replaces the prior ambient
# `LIVESPEC_PRECOMMIT_RED_MODE` env var with no env var and no spec change.

# First-touch setup — a THIN delegator to the shipped LOCAL first-touch
# reconcile verb (`livespec_dev_tooling.fleet.local_reconcile`), the
# generalized successor to this recipe's former inline steps (livespec-zs22.8
# M5). Reuse-first: NO copied logic — the verb walks the LOCAL obligation
# partition (`contract.LOCAL_OBLIGATION_ROWS`): mise trust/install, uv sync,
# the structural commit-refuse hooks (subsuming `lefthook install` — the
# canonical hook overwrites the lefthook stubs and delegates to `lefthook
# run`), the advisory `refs/notes/*` refspec, the worktree-root mise-trust
# entry, the beads tenant-dir hardening, the beads-runtime detect-and-guide
# probes, and project-scoped Claude/Codex plugin registration. The two plugin
# rows delegate back to THIS repo's own `ensure-plugins` / `ensure-codex-plugins`
# recipes below (the plugin set is repo-specific, so each governed repo's recipe
# stays the single source; a member lacking either recipe SKIPs that row). The
# verb resolves the target checkout worktree-safely via `git rev-parse
# --git-common-dir`, so invoking from a linked worktree still provisions the
# primary checkout's shared state. Mirrors the `install-commit-refuse-hooks`
# recipe's `uv run python -m ...` from-package invocation.
