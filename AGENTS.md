## Red-Green-Replay commit protocol

Product `.py` changes are committed via a 2-step single-commit TDD ritual,
enforced by the `red_green_replay` commit-refuse hook (it inspects the staged
tree and writes `TDD-*` trailers). The final result is ONE commit carrying the
test, the impl, and both trailer sets.

1. **Red commit.** Stage the test file ALONE — no impl — and commit with a
   `fix:`/`feat:` subject. The hook runs pytest on the staged tree; the new
   test MUST fail *meaningfully* (an assertion failure, NOT an `ImportError`
   or a collection error). It records `TDD-Red-*` trailers (test path, failure
   reason, test-file checksum, output checksum, captured-at).
   - Gotcha: the impl must be UNMODIFIED on disk at the Red commit, because the
     hook's pytest reads the on-disk module. If the impl already carries the
     change the test passes, and the hook rejects with `test-passed-at-red`.
2. **Green amend.** Stage the impl and run `git commit --amend`. The hook sees
   the `TDD-Red-*` trailers + the staged impl, re-runs the SAME test (now
   passing), and records `TDD-Green-*` trailers. The test file bytes MUST be
   byte-identical across the Red→Green pair; to change the test, author a fresh
   Red commit.

**Exempt:** changesets with no product `.py` (docs, spec, work-items, shell,
config) use `chore(...)` / `docs(...)` / `chore(spec):` subjects and skip the
ritual entirely. Always use `mise exec -- git ...` so the hooks fire; never
pass `--no-verify`.
